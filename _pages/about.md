## About Me

Hi everyone! I am **Zhirui Tian** (田智睿), a first-year Ph.D. student at School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). My major is Computer and Information Engineering (CIE), and I am very fortunate to be supervised by **Prof. Chenye Wu**. Before that, I obtained a bachelor's degree at School of Statistics, Dongbei University of Finance and Economics (DUFE), supervised by Prof. **Jianzhou Wang**. 

## My Interests

Now, I mainly focus on **AI+Energy**. At present, I am mainly good at the design of prediction algorithms based on deep learning, hybrid prediction system based on ensemble / combined model, and meta-heuristic optimization.

## News in 2024

**2024.2.10** My new research Paper "CNNs-Transformer based day-ahead probabilistic load forecasting for weekends with limited data availability" is now available online on **Energy (JCR Q1, IF=9)**, you can download the whole paper at [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.130666](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.130666). I am the first author of this paper, supervised by **Prof. Chenye Wu**.

**2024.2.6** I supervise three teams for The Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM) at Dongbei University of Finance and Economics. Thank you for your trust and I wish you good results.

**2024.1.2** My new research Paper "Football team training algorithm: A novel sport-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm for global optimization" is now available online on **Expert Systems with Applications (JCR Q1, IF=8.5)**, you can download the whole paper at [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.123088](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.123088).
