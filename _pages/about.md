## About Me

Hi everyone! I am **Zhirui Tian** (田智睿), a Ph.D. student at [School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/). My major is Computer and Information Engineering (CIE), and I am very fortunate to be supervised by [**Prof. Chenye Wu**](https://www.wuchenye.cn/index-cn.html). Before that, I obtained a bachelor's degree at [School of Statistics, Dongbei University of Finance and Economics (DUFE)](https://stat.dufe.edu.cn/), supervised by [**Prof. Jianzhou Wang**](https://www.must.edu.mo/cn/imedia/expert-list/mise). I rank the **2nd** in School of Statistics, DUFE with a GPA of (92.45/100), and was honored with the Outstanding Graduates of Dongbei University of Finance and Economics Award in 2023.

## My Interests

Currently, my research endeavors are principally centered on the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) + Energy Systems/Environment Systems**. I am dedicated to harnessing the advanced capabilities of deep learning and machine learning methodologies to conduct in-depth analyses of energy/environment datasets. The overarching aim of my work is to facilitate a transition towards more sustainable energy systems by optimizing energy consumption patterns and significantly mitigating carbon emissions. At the forefront of my interests lies a series of cutting-edge research themes:

**1. Exploring Deep Learning for Long-sequence Time-Series Forecasting (LSTF)**: My focus is on developing sophisticated neural network architectures (such as DNN based on Linear, seq2seq and encoder-decoder structures) that can accurately predict energy demands and renewable energy supply over mid/long term. This involves tackling the inherent challenges of long-sequence forecasting. At the same time, adopting multi-task learning technique, these models can also be applied to many classical downstream tasks, such as economic dispatch, etc.

**2. End-to-End Learning for Solving Objective Function Misalignment Problems in Smart Grid**: Ask yourself a question: The more accurate the stock forecast, the more money will be made? The correlation between stock forecast accuracy and potential profit is not always straightforward. When predictions cannot be entirely precise, the misalignment of the objective function may hinder improvements in downstream tasks, despite the increased precision of the forecast. We intend to address similar challenges in the power system/electricity market using end-to-end learning techniques. 

**3. Innovative Transfer Strategies for Few-shot Learning Problems**: I am investigating how to effectively adapt pre-trained models to new, limited-data contexts within the energy sector. This includes creating robust models that can generalize well from minor data quantity, thereby addressing the data scarcity issue prevalent in many specialized energy applications.

**4. Hybrid Framework Design for Ultra-short-term Time-Series Prediction**: My work involves the integration of various modeling approaches (such as ensemble model, combiend model and strategies after prediction) to enhance the accuracy of ultra-short-term forecasts. By combining different predictive models, we aim to leverage their respective strengths and mitigate their weaknesses, leading to superior prediction performance for critical applications like real-time energy dispatch and trading. We also explore the impact of data processing on prediction results, including data augmentation, one-hot ecoding, feature engineering, de-nosing strategy and some fuzzy methods.

**5. Developing, Advancement, and Application of Meta-heuristic Optimization Algorithms**: I am keen on developing and refining meta-heuristic algorithms to solve complex optimization problems in the energy domain. These algorithms are crucial for optimizing grid operations, enhancing the efficiency of energy systems, and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources. These interests involve single-objective as well as multi-objective optimization, the specific sub-directions are as follows.

(1) The performance of the current meta-heuristic optimizer in some complex test functions is not always satisfactory. Can we design a new meta-heuristic optimizer to solve it?

(2) How to improve meta-heuristic optimizer to achieve better performance in CEC function?

(3) How to apply the optimizer in the real problems, especially in prediction models to further enhance its accuracy?

(4) How to choose the point on the Pareto frontier that is more suitable for practical engineering problems?
