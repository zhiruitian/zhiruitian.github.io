Hi everyone! I am Zhirui Tian, a first-year Ph.D. student at School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). My major is Computer and Information Engineering (CIE), and I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Chenye Wu. Before that, I obtained a bachelor's degree in School of Statistics, Dongbei University of Finance and Economics (DUFE), supervised by Prof. Jianzhou Wang.
