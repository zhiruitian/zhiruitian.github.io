## About Me

Hi everyone! I am **Zhirui Tian** (田智睿), a Ph.D. student at [School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/). My major is Computer and Information Engineering (CIE), and I am very fortunate to be supervised by [**Prof. Chenye Wu**](https://www.wuchenye.cn/index-cn.html). Before that, I obtained a bachelor's degree at [School of Statistics, Dongbei University of Finance and Economics (DUFE)](https://stat.dufe.edu.cn/), supervised by [**Prof. Jianzhou Wang**](https://www.must.edu.mo/cn/imedia/expert-list/mise). I rank **2nd** in the School of Statistics, DUFE with a GPA of (92.45/100), and was honored with the Outstanding Graduates of Dongbei University of Finance and Economics Award in 2023.

## My Interests

Currently, my research endeavors are principally centered on the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) + Energy Systems/Environment Systems**. I am dedicated to harnessing the advanced capabilities of deep learning and machine learning methodologies to conduct in-depth analyses of energy/environment datasets. The overarching aim of my work is to facilitate a transition towards more sustainable energy systems by optimizing energy consumption patterns and significantly mitigating carbon emissions. At the forefront of my interests lies a series of cutting-edge research themes:


**1. Exploring Deep Learning for Long-sequence Time-Series Forecasting (LSTF):** My research focuses on developing novel neural network architectures, such as deep neural networks (DNN) based on Linear, Seq2seq, and Transformer structures, along with innovative information extraction techniques, including Multi-scale Learning, Multi-frequency Learning, PATCH Learning, and Time-Frequency Domain Fusion methods. The goal is to accurately predict energy demand and renewable energy supply over mid- to long-term horizons, addressing the inherent challenges of long-sequence forecasting. Additionally, by incorporating multi-modal/multi-task learning, these models can be applied to various classical downstream tasks, such as day-ahead economic dispatch (DAED), and photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting enhanced by satellite cloud images, among others.

**2. End-to-End Learning for Solving Objective Function Misalignment Problems in Smart Grid**: Ask yourself a question: The more accurate the stock forecast, the more money will be made? The correlation between stock forecast accuracy and potential profit is not always straightforward. When predictions cannot be entirely precise, the misalignment of the objective function may hinder improvements in downstream tasks, despite the increased precision of the forecast. We intend to address similar challenges in the power system/electricity market using end-to-end learning techniques. 

**3. Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Deployment:** In practical engineering applications, deploying models with large numbers of parameters is costly and resource-intensive. Moreover, the need to send all data to remote servers or data centers for processing limits the ability to perform efficient real-time dispatch and decision-making. To overcome these challenges, we are exploring novel knowledge distillation techniques for time-series forecasting and smart electricity meter data analysis that transfer knowledge from large, pre-trained models into smaller, more efficient models. This approach not only alleviates the computational burden but also facilitates more effective deployment in resource-constrained, local environments, thereby enhancing both cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency.

**4. Innovative Transfer Strategies for Few-shot Learning Problems**: I am investigating how to effectively adapt pre-trained models to new, limited-data contexts within the energy sector. This includes creating robust models that can generalize well from minor data quantity, thereby addressing the data scarcity issue prevalent in many specialized energy applications.

**5. Hybrid Framework Design for Ultra-short-term Time-Series Prediction**: My work involves the integration of various modeling approaches (such as ensemble model, combined model, and strategies after prediction) to enhance the accuracy of ultra-short-term forecasts. By combining different predictive models, we aim to leverage their respective strengths and mitigate their weaknesses, leading to superior prediction performance for critical applications like real-time energy dispatch and trading. We also explore the impact of data processing on prediction results, including data augmentation, one-hot encoding, feature engineering, de-nosing strategy, and some fuzzy methods.

**6. Developing, Advancement, and Application of Evolutionary Computation**: I am keen on developing and refining meta-heuristic algorithms to solve complex optimization problems in the energy domain. These algorithms are crucial for optimizing grid operations, enhancing the efficiency of energy systems, and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources. These interests involve single-objective as well as multi-objective optimization, the specific sub-directions are as follows.

1) Existing meta-heuristic optimization algorithms often perform poorly on high-dimensional optimization problems. How can we design new meta-heuristic optimization, or enhance original meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to address this issue?

2) How can a Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (SAEA) be designed to solve Expensive Optimization Problems (EOP) better?

3) How can we better expand/shrink the Pareto Frontier to meet practical engineering applications when dealing with multi-objective/many-objective optimization problems?
