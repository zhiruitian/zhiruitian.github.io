## About Me

Hi everyone! I am **Zhirui Tian** (田智睿), a Ph.D. student at School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). My major is Computer and Information Engineering (CIE), and I am very fortunate to be supervised by **Prof. Chenye Wu**. Before that, I obtained a bachelor's degree at School of Statistics, Dongbei University of Finance and Economics (DUFE), supervised by **Prof. Jianzhou Wang**. 

## My Interests

Now, I mainly focus on **AI+Energy**. I am committed to using deep learning/machine learning methods to better analyze energy data and achieve the effect of reducing carbon emissions. At present, I am mainly interested in：

1. Deep learning for Long-sequence Time-series Forecasting (LSTF) problems.
2. Transfer strategy design for Few-shot Learning problems.
3. Hybrid framework design for higher Ultra-short-term Time-series Prediction accuracy.
4. Development, Improvement, and Application of Meta-heuristic Optimization Algorithms.
