## About Me

Hi everyone! I am **Zhirui Tian** (田智睿), a first-year Ph.D. student at School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). My major is Computer and Information Engineering (CIE), and I am very fortunate to be supervised by **Prof. Chenye Wu**. Before that, I obtained a bachelor's degree at School of Statistics, Dongbei University of Finance and Economics (DUFE), supervised by Prof. **Jianzhou Wang**. 

## My Interests

Now, I mainly focus on **AI+Energy**. At present, I am mainly good at the design of prediction algorithms based on deep learning, hybrid prediction system based on ensemble / combined model, and meta-heuristic optimization.
